# Genesys Terrarium

Genesys Terrarium is a modular ecosystem simulation created in Godot.

Note: Most of the features written here are not implemented yet or are still very basic, this is just to show the planned features of the project. This project is on indefinite hold while we finish grad school ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜´

## Key Features

### Dynamic Ecosystem Simulation

![Ecosystem overview](extra/github_resources/bun_gif_1.gif)

Simulates a comprehensive ecosystem with multiple interacting species. Including:

- Diverse plants and animals with distinct behaviors and needs
- Predator-prey relationships with state-driven interactions
- Environmental factors influencing species' behavior and survival

### Entity Inspection and Analysis

![Entity inspection interface](extra/github_resources/bun_gif_2.gif)

Interact with individual entities within the simulation to access detailed information:

- Changing status indicators (health, hunger, thirst, etc.)
- Performance metrics (speed, hunting efficiency)
- Generational data for tracking lineage

### Adaptive Behavior Systems

Entities inherit adaptive behaviors based on their current state and environmental conditions:

- Priority-based decision making (e.g., foraging vs. seeking safety)
- Dynamic response to threats and opportunities
- Basic resource management (energy conservation, risk assessment)

### Evolutionary Mechanics

- Mutation and inheritance systems for passing traits between generations
- Multi-generational tracking of genetic lineages
- Visualization tools for analyzing evolutionary trends over time

### Scenario Creation and Customization

- Procedural generation capabilities for randomized scenarios
- Fine-tuned control over initial conditions and simulation parameters
- Ability to add in new hazards or entities during runtime
- Fast-forward, pause, and other sim controls

### Data Analysis and Visualization

Access and view different types of data from each simulation:

- Real-time population tracking and species distribution
- Resource availability and consumption metrics
- Customizable graphs and charts for visualizing simulation data

## Potential Applications / Future Work

- Incorporate reinforcement learning over different generations
- Prototype for a more specialized state-based environmental simulation
- Demonstration of AI and data visualization capabilities in an interactive, real-time environment
